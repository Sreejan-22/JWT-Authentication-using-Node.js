Client -> Server
Data from client gets stored in Server
Client has to somehow authenticate as who it is 
Why? => Server is a central computer which is something that I control(I am writing the backend of this app)
Client is a computer that I do not control
So there must be some sort of verification

There are  ways to authenticate:
1. Client proves itself with some secret/data(which is non changeable) (JWT)
2. Client-Server share some secret(cookie)
